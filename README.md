# 🧠 Project X

> *"Your mind matters — let's build something that reminds you of that."*

Project X is a personal mental health support platform that aims to help individuals navigate their emotions, understand their inner world, and find the tools they need for healing and growth. This project is built with empathy at its core—it’s more than code; it’s care, design, and intention.

## 🌱 Vision

We believe that mental health support should be:
- **Accessible**: Simple, intuitive tools that anyone can use.
- **Personalised**: Reflecting each user’s unique emotional landscape.
- **Non-judgmental**: A safe space to check in, reflect, and grow.
- **Culturally rooted**: With language, expressions, and metaphors that resonate.

## ✨ Features (Planned & In Progress)

| Feature | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Mood Tracker | 🟡 In progress | Daily check-ins with mood, energy, sleep, and focus levels |
| Journal Prompts | 🟡 In progress | Reflective, AI-generated prompts tailored to user patterns |
| Audio Notes | 🔜 Planned | Record your thoughts when typing feels too hard |
| Resource Hub | 🔜 Planned | Curated articles, breathing exercises, podcasts, and more |
| Crisis Button | 🔜 Planned | Immediate access to help in emergencies or panic attacks |
| Dark Mode | ✅ Done | Because your eyes deserve peace too |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Area | Stack |

| Frontend | React (possibly Next.js), Tailwindcss |
| Backend | Node.js (Express), Mongodb |

## 💡 Name Ideas

Project X is a placeholder, but here are some names on the table:

- **Nafs** (نفس) – Soul/psyche/breath — raw, poetic, grounded in Arabic philosophy.
- **Sootak** (صوتك) – "Your Voice" — human-centred, empowering.
- **Dayrah** (دايرة) – "Circle" — symbolising community, safety, and emotional cycles.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a functioning MVP by **[insert your timeline, e.g., August 2025]**
- Test with real users and iterate based on feedback.
- Create both web and mobile versions.
- Launch an open-source version for communities to adapt.

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Define user personas and primary use cases
- [ ] Build low-fidelity wireframes
- [ ] Set up backend APIS (auth, journaling, mood logs)
- [ ] Build and connect frontend components
- [ ] Integrate AI for journaling support
- [ ] Test MVP and gather feedback

## 🧘‍♂️ Core Values

- **Privacy First** – Your data stays yours. Always.
- **Inclusive Design** – Every identity and background matters.
- **Mental Health is Not a Luxury** – It’s a right, not a privilege.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is currently a solo passion project, but collaboration is welcome as the project matures. Whether you're a dev, designer, therapist, or poet, your perspective can add value.
