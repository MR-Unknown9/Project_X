# 🧠 Project X

> *"Your mind matters — let's build something that reminds you of that."*

Project X is a personal mental health support platform designed to help individuals navigate their emotions, understand their inner world, and find the tools they need for healing and growth. This project is built with empathy at its core; it’s more than just code—it’s about care, design, and intention.

---

## 🌱 Vision

We believe that mental health support should be:
- **Accessible**: Simple, intuitive tools that anyone can use.
- **Personalised**: Reflecting each user’s unique emotional landscape.
- **Non-judgmental**: A safe space to check in, reflect, and grow.
- **Culturally rooted**: Incorporating language, expressions, and metaphors that resonate.
